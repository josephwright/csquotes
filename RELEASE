RELEASE NOTES FOR VERSION 5.1

*  Improved block quotation facilities

   The hightlight of this release is an extension of the block
   quotation facilities. When measuring the length of a quotation,
   \blockquote and related commands can determine either the word
   count or the number of lines. See the pointers in the changelog
   for details.

RELEASE NOTES FOR VERSION 5.0

*  Backwards compatibility

   This release introduces some changes which are not backwards
   compatible out of the box. In order to ease the transition to the
   new version, I've implemented a 'version' option which emulates
   older versions of csquotes.

   It is quite possible that you do not need to set this option at
   all, even though you have older documents using csquotes. You
   only need the 'version' option in older documents if:

   - you are using the <punct> argument of \blockquote and/or
   - you have redefined any of the old
     '\mk(pre|mid|fin)(text|block|disp)punct' hooks.

   If these conditions do not apply and you run 5.0 with the default
   settings, the output will be similar to 4.4. There is absolutely
   no need to set 'version=4.4' if you didn't use the old hooks and
   the <punct> argument of \blockquote anyway.

   I've also removed some legacy aliases. This is rather old stuff
   from csquotes 3.x and even 2.x which has been marked as
   depreciated for some time. Setting 'version=4.4' will restore
   them as well.

*  Punctuation look-ahead

   This release comes with a new punctuation look-ahead feature,
   i.e., in addition to the <punct> argument of advanced quotation
   commands like \textquote, these commands can now scan ahead for
   trailing punctuation after their last argument and move it around
   if desired.
   
   This is required by quoting conventions such as the US quotation
   style which requires that a period or a comma immediately after a
   closing quotation mark be moved inside the quotes even if it is
   not part of the quoted text.

   The implementation of the look-ahead feature also implies a new
   interpretation of the optional <punct> argument supported by
   certain quotation commands. In previous version, the <punct>
   argument was intended for terminal punctuation which is NOT part
   of the quoted text. Starting with this release, it is intended
   for punctuation which IS part of the quoted text (but may need to
   be moved around).

   The modified syntax is more intuitive to use because terminal
   punctuation which is NOT part of the quoted text is simply placed
   after the last argument of the command, i.e.:

	\textquote[citation][.]{quoted text}
   
   becomes:
   
	\textquote[citation]{quoted text}.

   All of this is discussed at length in the manual. See the
   changelog in the manual for pointers to the relevant sections.

*  Revised quotation hooks

   The old quotation hooks:

	\mkpretextpunct
	\mkmidtextpunct
	\mkfintextpunct
	\mkpreblockpunct
	\mkmidblockpunct
	\mkfinblockpunct
	\mkpredisppunct
	\mkmiddisppunct
	\mkfindisppunct

   have been removed and are replaced by new hooks:

	\mktextquote
	\mkblockquote
	\mkbegdispquote
	\mkenddispquote

   which are much more powerful while being more intuitive to use.
   If you have been using the old hooks in some documents, set
   'version=4.4' to emulate the old interface.
